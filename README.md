## Project: Coarse-Grained Modeling of Multi-Stranded RNA Nanostructures

This is a project studying the sturctural formation and dynamics of multi-stranded RNA nanostars. The scripts included in this project are used to analyze molecular dynamics simulation data from oxDNA.

You will need a topology and configuration file from oxView. The code requires 3 replicates, thus you must generate 3 topology and configuration files. These will be averaged out to minimize outlier behaviors such as arm-stacking.
